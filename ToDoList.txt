· ### Eliminate "if" statements from "book_class". We will be use that on "client_class". ✓✓
· ### Change filemanager class. It will return None if we can't read a file. ✓✓
· ### In library class, we create two new attributes like empty book list and empty client list. ✓✓
· ### We will have a method called ‘load_books’ for example. There we will create a filemanager object that will try to
  read a file. If it can't do that, then this method will advise the user thanks to ‘if - else’ statements. ✓✓
· ### On that method, if it can read the file, then it will convert all data to usable objects, and then it will append
  those elements to the main list. ✓✓
· ### In our client list, we will have the same method as the last one. ✓✓
· ### IMPORTANT: Change the content of client's list (it had Book-type objects before) to integer (like ISBN). ✓✓

· Give a sight to "logger information" on "book_class" and "client_class": it's the same info. Change it!

· Improve event class and finish al new methods on library class.
· Start to create the main.py file, all classes finisehd!
